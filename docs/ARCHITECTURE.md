# InstaEditLogin — Architecture

## Overview

InstaEditLogin is a Go monolith with a React/Vite SPA frontend and a PostgreSQL database. It authenticates users via OAuth 2.0 against multiple social platforms and publishes content on their behalf.

## Layers

```

## Data Flow

1. User clicks login on a social provider.
2. Backend redirects to provider OAuth URL with a server-generated state cookie.
3. Provider redirects back to `/api/v1/auth/{provider}/callback`.
4. Backend exchanges code, fetches profile, creates/updates user and platform account.
5. Backend issues a JWT and redirects to the SPA callback.
6. SPA uses the JWT for authenticated calls to posts, accounts, workspaces.
7. Publishing creates `posts` and `post_targets`; the worker dispatches to providers.

## Security

- Tokens are encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM.
- JWT is signed with HS256 and validated by middleware.
- OAuth state is stored in an HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Lax cookie.
- Strict JWT auth is enforced in production.
